This my fist ever project as an aspiring front-end developer
This project will consist of many steps as i continue to add more funtions to the webpage.

#1 Create a responsive navigation bar with the hover effect.

#2 design a background theme for the page.

#3 Create links for the Project, About and Contacts tabs.

#4 Add a resume Button for downloading my Resume.

I aim to update the webpage every two days and add more functions as I continue with my development Journey.
